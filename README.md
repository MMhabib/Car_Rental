# ðŸš€ Working on the Server

All the frontend work has been completed successfully. The application features a clean, responsive design developed with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. Key frontend features include:

- Modular and reusable React components for maintainability
- Responsive layout supporting multiple device sizes
- Integration with ImageKit for optimized image handling
- Smooth user experience with dynamic rendering and state management

You can check the client-side of the applicationâ€”it works perfectly fine without the server as I have included dummy data for demonstration purposes.

**Note:** Backend server integration is currently in progress.
